## Overview

RSMT (Real-time Stylized Motion Transition for Characters) is a deep learning model for generating high-quality, stylized character motion transitions in real-time. It builds upon earlier work in real-time controllable motion transitions, with enhancements for style control.

The RSMT model consists of several key components:
- Phase Manifold for temporal encoding
- Manifold component for spatial encoding
- Sampler for generating the transitions

For more detailed information, please refer to the original paper and the specific documentation sections listed above.
