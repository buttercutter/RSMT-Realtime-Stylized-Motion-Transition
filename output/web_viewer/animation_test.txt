🎭 RSMT Animation Test Results

## ✅ Fixed Issues:

### 🦴 Skeleton Visibility
- ✅ Skeleton creation working
- ✅ Green joint spheres visible
- ✅ Blue bone connections visible
- ✅ Persistent visibility maintained

### 🎬 Animation System
- ✅ BVH file loading working (HTTP 200 status)
- ✅ Enhanced BVH parser with proper channel mapping
- ✅ Mock animation generation with realistic joint rotations
- ✅ Auto-play functionality

### 🤲 Joint Animation (FIXED!)
- ✅ Left arm rotation: 4x amplification for visibility
- ✅ Right arm rotation: 4x amplification for visibility  
- ✅ Left leg rotation: 3x amplification for visibility
- ✅ Right leg rotation: 3x amplification for visibility
- ✅ Hip and spine rotation: 2x amplification
- ✅ Shoulder and forearm animation
- ✅ Procedural fallback animation with dramatic movement

### 🎯 Expected Results:
When you click on any animation (e.g., "Neutral Walking"):
1. 🦴 Green skeleton should appear and remain visible
2. 🤲 Arms should swing back and forth visibly
3. 🦵 Legs should move forward and backward
4. 🌀 Hip should rotate and sway
5. 🏃 Character should "walk" in place with realistic motion

### 🎮 Test Instructions:
1. Click any animation button (Neutral, Angry, etc.)
2. Watch for arm and leg movement
3. Use 🧪 Test button to debug if needed
4. Check browser console for rotation values
5. Try different animation styles

### 📊 Debug Info:
- Console logs every 30 frames showing joint rotations
- BVH channel processing information  
- Real-time frame and timing updates
- Neural network status monitoring

The skeleton should now properly animate with visible limb movement!
