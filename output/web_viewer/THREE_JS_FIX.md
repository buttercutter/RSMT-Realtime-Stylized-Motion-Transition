# THREE.js Issue Resolution

## Problem
The `three.min.js` file contained HTML instead of JavaScript, causing:
- `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'` 
- `THREE defined: false`
- Scene creation failures

## Root Cause
The original `three.min.js` file (9,379 bytes) was actually an HTML error page, not the JavaScript library.

## Solution
Downloaded the correct THREE.js library from CDN:
```bash
wget -O three.min.js https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.160.0/build/three.min.js
```

## Result
- File size: 655K (correct JavaScript)
- THREE.js now loads properly
- 3D scene creation works
- Animation system functional
